## ðŸ’Š Pharmacy Inventory Management System â€“ SQL Project

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview:**
This project models a complete **pharmacy inventory and order management system** using **relational database design** in SQL. It captures key business processes such as product inventory, customer orders, supplier stock management, and order processing by pharmacists.

## ðŸ”§ Key Components

### ðŸ§± **Entities & Attributes:**

1. **Customer**
   Stores customer details such as ID, name, age, city, email, and phone number. Includes a check constraint to ensure age is positive.

2. **Products**
   Holds information about medicines: name, price, expiry date, type (e.g., tablet or syrup), and an optional description. Includes validation to ensure price is non-negative.

3. **Supplier**
   Maintains data about suppliers, including contact and city.

4. **Inventory**
   Tracks which products are supplied by which suppliers, along with stock quantity and last restock date. Links products and suppliers using foreign keys.

5. **Pharmacist**
   Stores contact information of pharmacists responsible for processing customer orders.

6. **Orders**
   Represents orders placed by customers and handled by pharmacists. Includes automatic timestamping for the order date.

7. **Order Details** (Junction Table)
   Implements the **many-to-many relationship** between **orders** and **products**. Stores the quantity of each product ordered.

8. **Order Summary** (View)
   A **virtual table** that combines order information, customer details, product names, quantities, prices, and total amounts â€” making it easy to analyze sales data without complex joins.

## ðŸ”— Relationship Overview:

* **One-to-Many:**

  * A customer can place multiple orders
  * A pharmacist can handle multiple orders
  * A supplier can supply multiple products

* **Many-to-Many:**

  * An order can contain multiple products, and a product can appear in multiple orders
  * Implemented using the **Order_Details** junction table

* **Optional Attributes:**
  Fields like email, phone number, and product descriptions are optional to allow flexibility.

* **Constraints Used:**

  * Primary Keys for entity uniqueness
  * Foreign Keys for relational integrity
  * Check constraints for data validation (e.g., age > 0, price â‰¥ 0)
  * Default values for timestamps

## ðŸ§  What I Learned:

* Designing normalized databases with clear entity relationships
* Managing many-to-many relationships using junction tables
* Using views to simplify reporting and data access
* Enforcing data integrity with SQL constraints
* Writing readable, scalable SQL structures

ðŸ“ˆ **This database design is ideal for small pharmacy systems**, and it can be extended to include billing, prescription tracking, and supplier restocking alerts.
